First, init:
	- posX and posY which are the positions of the vector camera/player
	- planeX and planeY which are the positions of the vector plane (screen)
	  for an ideal FOV, planeX should be 0 and planeY should be 0.66
	- dirX and dirY which are the positions of the vector direction (rays)
	  dirX should be init at -1 and dirY at 0

We can than calculate the rays directions:
rayDirX = dirX + planeX * cameraX
rayDirY = dirY + planeY * cameraX
in which cameraX is the position on the pixel column you're currently on

Then, we need to calculate the deltaDistX and deltaDistY which are the distances needed to the ray to go from an x-side or a y-side to another

These can be calculated by doing:
deltaDistX = sqrt (1 / (rayDirY * rayDirY) / (rayDirX * rayDirX));
deltaDistY = sqrt (1 / (rayDirX * rayDirX) / (rayDirY * rayDirY));
